      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>
        Through this proposal, we partner with community health organizations (CHOs) in Baltimore, Maryland to engage and retain a diverse group of participants from a hard-to-reach population (individuals living in low-income neighborhoods) in a participatory artificial intelligence (AI) project that has the potential for social good – better supporting patients as they try to use their medical records. The research activities include key informant interviews, and a series of focus group and co-design sessions. Education about the benefits and limitations of generative AI (genAI) will be integrated into each touchpoint. Key outcomes will include an open-source toolkit that offers practical tools (e.g., effective recruitment strategies) for engaging hard-to-reach populations in participatory AI.

      <summary>Research Goals and Problem Statement</summary>
      <p>
        Patients gained greater access to their electronic health information (EHI) than ever before with the 2016 21st Century Cures Act, which requires that medical records be provided to patients immediately upon their request. While this aligns with patient preferences, research shows patients often need support in using their EHI for decision-making. Without support, they may turn to inconsistent information sources or experience negative emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, digital health disparities persist—differences in technology adoption and use that can worsen health disparities. Engaging underrepresented populations throughout technology design is a key strategy to prevent these disparities, but hard-to-reach populations face barriers such as mistrust and limited resources. Our goal is to trial strategies for engaging low socioeconomic status (SES) communities in Baltimore in a participatory AI project to co-design a tool that helps them understand and use their medical records. We aim to produce a framework, guiding principles, and a practical toolkit to support other researchers and developers.

      <summary>Description of the Proposed Work, Expected Outcomes, and Results</summary>
      <p>
        The project has three interrelated aims:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aim 1:</strong> Co-design a genAI tool for understanding and using medical records with underserved individuals in Baltimore. We will explore current awareness of AI, preferred tool features, and what success looks like for these populations through key informant interviews, focus groups, and co-design sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aim 2:</strong> Build a framework and toolkit for effective participatory AI engagement in hard-to-reach populations. We will test different engagement, retention, and co-design strategies and measure their effectiveness in bringing individuals into AI discussions and maintaining participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aim 3:</strong> Educate stakeholders in under-resourced settings about the potential and risks of genAI. We will provide guided introductions to free genAI tools and discuss both benefits and limitations, aiming to bridge the knowledge gap and promote informed use.
