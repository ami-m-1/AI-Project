      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>
      Through this proposal we partnered with community health organizations (CHOs) in Baltimore, Maryland to engage and retain a diverse group of participants from a hard-to-reach population (individuals living in low-income neighborhoods) in a participatory artificial intelligence (AI) project that itself has the potential for social good â€“ better supporting patients as they try to use their medical records. The research activities include key informant interviews, and a series of focus group and co-design sessions. Education about the benefits and limitations of generative AI (genAI) will be integrated into each of the touchpoints. Key outcomes of the project will include an open-source toolkit that offer practical tools (e.g., effective recruitment strategies) for engaging hard-to-reach populations in participatory AI.
